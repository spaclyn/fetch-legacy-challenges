------------

There are four challenges in this project: Cats Challenge, Search Challenge, Dogs Challenge, and ToDo Challenge. These challenge will focus on different portions of both React Legacy code and applying logic and escalate in difficulty.

 - The Cats Challenge is a debug challenge,
 - The Search Challenge includes some debugging but focuses primarily on writing logic,
 - The Dogs Challenge focuses on fetching and displaying data in React,
 - The ToDo Challenge is an opportunity to apply everything you have seen up until this point throughout your experience at Eleven Fifty Academy

Good luck!
